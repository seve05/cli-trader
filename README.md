Multi_filings_analysis function coded by me, added on supplementary functions I personally wanted to have like looking up prices in real time, review historic quarters, get macro insights all in the command line for the sake of completeness. This requires Ollama install and the specific model you want to use.
1. install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. navigate to folder `cli_trader/tr_functions`
3. `python3 any_of_the_tools`
